# SE347 final project

## Contribute rules

-   For each feature, create a separate branch with the following prefixes:
    -   Frontend: `/fe/feature-name` (e.g., `/fe/add-color`)
    -   Backend: `/be/feature-name` (e.g., `/be/add-authentication`)
-   Do not push directly to the `main` branch. Instead, push to `origin <your_branch>` and create a pull request.
